## 1. Overview

This policy outlines Greip’s approach to API updates, versioning, and deprecation. It ensures a smooth transition for developers when changes are introduced and provides clear guidelines on how long older versions will be supported before they are phased out.

By using the Greip API, you agree to stay informed about updates and adjust your integration accordingly to maintain compatibility.

## 2. API Versioning & Updates

Greip follows a versioned API approach to maintain stability while introducing improvements. Versions are structured as:

```
v[Major].[Minor].[Patch]  (Example: v1.2.3)
```

- Major Updates (vX.0.0)
  - Introduce significant changes, including breaking changes that may require code adjustments.
  - Announced at least 2 months before deprecation of the previous major version.
- Minor Updates (vX.Y.0)
  - Add new features or improvements without breaking existing functionality.
  - Recommended but not mandatory for users to upgrade immediately.
- Patch Updates (vX.Y.Z)
  - Contain bug fixes, security enhancements, and performance optimizations.
  - Automatically applied and require no action unless otherwise stated.

Developers should integrate with the latest stable version to benefit from performance, security, and feature improvements.

## 3. Deprecation & Sunset Policy

To ensure long-term reliability, Greip may deprecate older API versions when necessary. The deprecation process follows these steps:

### 3.1 Deprecation Announcement

- Deprecation notices will be communicated via:
- Greip API Documentation (docs.greip.io)
- Email notifications (for registered users with active API keys)
- Dashboard alerts (if applicable)
- The notice period for deprecation depends on the impact of the change:
- Major version deprecation: Minimum 2 months notice before end-of-life.
- Minor version deprecation: Minimum 2 months notice.
- Patch versions are not deprecated individually unless a security issue arises.

### 3.2 Sunset Phase (End-of-Life)

- After the deprecation period, the API version will be officially sunset and no longer accessible.
- Requests to deprecated versions may return HTTP 410 (Gone) or be redirected to the latest version if possible.
- API keys using outdated versions will not be disabled but will no longer work with the deprecated endpoints.

## 4. Mandatory Migrations

Certain updates may require developers to migrate to a newer API version. This happens when:

- Security vulnerabilities exist in the deprecated version.
- Underlying technology dependencies are no longer supported.
- A major architectural change is introduced.

Developers are expected to proactively update their integrations to avoid disruptions. Greip will provide migration guides and technical support during transitions.

## 5. Backward Compatibility & Grace Periods

- Non-breaking changes (e.g., new parameters, additional fields) will be introduced without affecting existing integrations.
- Breaking changes (e.g., removal of fields, altered response formats) will be announced in advance, and a grace period will be provided.
- Deprecated endpoints may remain operational in “Legacy Mode” for an extended time before final removal.

## 6. Testing New Versions

- Developers can test new versions in a sandbox environment before full migration.
- Greip will provide changelogs and migration documentation for major updates.

## 7. Support for Deprecated Versions

- Once an API version reaches its end-of-life (EOL), it will no longer receive bug fixes, security patches, or support.
- Paid enterprise users may request extended support for deprecated versions under a separate agreement.

## 8. Staying Updated

To ensure a seamless experience, developers should:

- ✅ Subscribe to API update notifications via their Greip dashboard.
- ✅ Regularly check the [API Changelog](https://changelog.greip.io/) for upcoming changes.
- ✅ Follow best practices for version handling in their implementation.
