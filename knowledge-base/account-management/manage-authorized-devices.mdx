You can manage the devices that are authorized to access your account. This feature is useful if you want to revoke access to a device that you no longer use or if you suspect that your account has been compromised.

To manage authorized devices, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    Go to the [Account Settings page](https://dashboard.greip.io/settings) from
    the account dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
    Under the 'Security settings' section, click on the 'Manage' button on the
    right side of the "Authorized devices" setting as shown below:
  </Step>
  <Step title="Third Step">
    You will see a list of devices that are currently authorized to access your
    account. To revoke access to a device, click on the 'Revoke' button next to
    the device.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
You can enter domain names and/or IP Addresses in this field.

For example: let's say you want to send requests to the API from client-side using our JS Package and in the same time you're using our PHP Library to send request from the server-side. Then you have to add your domain name (where your client-side is hosted) and your server IP Address (where you use the PHP Library).

E.g:

```diff
+ domain.com
+ sub.domain.com
+ 123.45.67.89
```

</Note>

<Warning>
**Important Notes**

1. If you use subdomains, then you have to list them all.
2. If you use CloudFlare or any other service that using Proxy approach and you want to whitelist your server IP Address, then just add the **real server IP address**.
3. If you leave the authorised hosts field empty, then **you're telling us that you want to allow all domains and IP addresses to use the API Key**.

</Warning>
