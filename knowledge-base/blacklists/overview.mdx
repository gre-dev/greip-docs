Blacklists allow you to block specific IP addresses, emails, email domains, customer IDs, customer IP addresses, card BINs, or card countries. This guide provides an overview of the blacklist feature, its benefits, and how to create and manage blacklists in Greip.

## Adding a blacklist

To add a new blacklist, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    Go to the [Blacklists page](https://dashboard.greip.io/blacklists) from the
    account dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
    Click on the 'Add new' button from the top right corner of the page to
    create a new blacklist.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Third Step">
    Give it a title that describes the list. This will help you identify the
    rule later.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fourth Step">
    Choose the type of blacklist you want to create.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fifth Step">
    Click the "Add blacklist" button to save the new blacklist.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sixth Step">
    Click on the name of the the blacklist you just created to add values to it
    (e.g: IP addresses, emails, etc.).
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once you have added values to a blacklist, it will be considered immediately when you use the API.

## Sample response with a blacklist detection

When the speicified value is found in one of your blacklists, the API will set the `blacklisted` property to `true` in the response. Here is a sample response:

<CodeGroup>

```json BIN Lookup
{
  "data": {
    "blacklisted": true
    // ...
  }
}
```

```json Geoip, IP Lookup
{
  "data": {
    // ...
    "security": {
      // ...
      "blacklisted": false
    }
  }
}
```

```json IP Reputation
{
  "data": {
    // ...
    "threats": {
      // ...
      "blacklisted": true
    }
  }
}
```

```json Email Scoring
{
  "data": {
    // ...
    "blacklisted": false
  }
}
```

```json Phone Scoring
{
  "data": {
    // ...
    "blacklisted": false
  }
}
```
