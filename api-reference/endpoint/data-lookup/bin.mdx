### Overview

The IIN (Issuer Identification Number), also known as the BIN (Bank Identification Number), is the first 6 digits of a debit or credit card number. These unique numbers are used to identify the issuing entity, such as the bank or financial institution that issued the card.

One of the most common and critical use cases of this method is to detect and prevent fraud payments in your app or website. This is an essential task for any business that accepts online payments, as fraud can lead to significant financial losses and reputational damage.

For example, based on of our case studies, if you notice a user from the UK purchasing large amounts of your product, and the card used for payment is issued by a bank located in the US, this could be a red flag. This may indicate that the user is using a stolen or fraudulent card to complete the checkout process. By flagging such transactions for review or rejection, you can prevent fraud and protect your business from financial loss.
