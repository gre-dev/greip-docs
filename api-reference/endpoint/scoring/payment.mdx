## Overview

Detecting and preventing fraudulent payments is a critical task for any business that accepts online payments. This AI-based module is designed to help you do that by analysing a range of data points related to each transaction.

Using sophisticated machine learning algorithms, this method can detect and flag potentially fraudulent transactions by analysing user data, user behaviour, user device, and other factors. For example, if a transaction appears to be coming from an unusual location or device, or if the user's behaviour is inconsistent with their past transactions, this method can flag the transaction for further review or rejection.

One of the key advantages of this AI-based module is its ability to adapt and learn over time. As it analyses more data and detects more fraud, it can improve its accuracy and efficiency, making it a highly effective tool for preventing financial losses due to fraud.

By implementing this method in your payment processing system, you can help protect your business and your customers from fraudulent activity, while providing a seamless and secure payment experience.
