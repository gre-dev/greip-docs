title: "Email Scoring"
description: "This method provides an additional layer of validation for your system. While validating email syntax is important, it is not sufficient.\n\nThis method goes beyond syntax validation by checking the domain's validity, the availability of the Mail Service, detecting Disposable Email (Temporary Emails), etc. By utilising this method, you can ensure a more thorough validation process for email addresses."
